Java project that currently can play .wav files.

MusicalComposition class has two subclasses:
1. NoteComposition
    With NoteComposition class it is possible to arrange notes and their types into a buffer and play using play() method. By using play(int bpm) it is possible to set Beats Per Minute of the song.
2. WavComposition
    WavComposition plays wav files. Use play() method to play songs. By using method setSongLengthInSeconds(int length) it is possible to change the desired length of the song. If this method is not used, the class sets the length of the song the default play length.
